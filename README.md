# Top 3 Mobile Apps for Managing EC2 Instances on AWS

When the cloud was the narrative in and of itself, few people considered optimizing the tools for navigating and nurturing their systems on the cloud. Of course, this was before the explosion of the mobile application sector. As the capacity of AWS cloud installations grows, and cost optimization becomes essential, a substantial moon-launch-style static command center to control EC2 instances is exceptionally undesirable. Several mobile apps are available to assist cloud managers, support engineers, CTOs, and CIOs in keeping an eye on the cloud. The AWS Console (Amazon Web Services) (Free on iOS and Android)

Amazon EC2 Client for Android, Decaf $14

Eazy2's formal name is Eazy2 (Free on iOS and Android)
1. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Console is an obvious choice for anyone utilizing AWS services to manage their EC2 instances and get a sense of how much they're paying. It covers the whole spectrum of AWS services, including CloudFront (Amazon's Web hosting service) and Route 53 (Amazon's Domain Name System Web service), as well as S3 storage and Relational Database Services (RDS). The software is available for free on both the iOS and Android app stores. The only disadvantage mentioned by users is that the app is not native. The user experience is relatively poor compared to some of the other options on the list, which offer less functionality but a vastly superior experience.

2. decaffeinated Amazon EC2 Client for Android is a paid software that provides the majority of the capabilities provided by Amazon but with a more streamlined native Android interface. It does not support multiple users and is confined to managing EC2 instances; however, it does have a password protection feature. This software also allows users to play with different areas, making it a fantastic choice if many people share your phone or tablet. The software costs a hefty $14 and does not support load balancers or network interfaces.

3. Eazy2, like Decaf, focuses on AWS cloud EC2 instance management. Eazy2 is a free app that is accessible for both iOS and Android. EC2 is natively developed on both platforms and provides a simple user interface and an excellent user experience. The AWS Console has more capability, but Eazy2 compensates for its limitations in performance and simplicity of use. Eazy2 supports multiple accounts, unlike Decaf Amazon EC2 Client. Users may ascertain the current cost/hours of each operating instance(s) and search for examples across several repositories. Instance details like name, zone, type, owner, and so on are readily accessible, and the creators of Eazy2 have incorporated updates and connections to the AWS Blog.
